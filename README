## Xvfb

wkhtmltoimage requires an X11 server in order to render the HTML to be 
captured. I've chosen to use xvfb to do this. To install on ubuntu, simply 
run the following;

    $ sudo apt-get install xvfb

## Useage

    $save_path = /absolute/path/to/image.jpg';
    $url = 'http://www.url.to.capture.com/';
    
    $h2i = new dsHtml2Image($url,$save_path);
    $h2i->setOptions(array(
        'quality' => 80,
        'disable-javascript' => ''   
    ));
    $img = $h2i->getImage();

Will capture a full size screen capture of the url supplied, with the 
quality set at 80% and the javascript disabled and save to the path 
you specified.

The method getImage will return an instance of sfImage preloaded with the 
screen capture for you to manipulate as required.
